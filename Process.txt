I used Tensorflow as backend.
Layers used are Conv2D,MaxPool2D,Flatten,Dense layers top of it is Sequential which is a model
using "keras.preprocessing.image" package to preprocess images in which image pixels are normalized between 0-1.
using flow_from_dataframe method in preprocessing we can send our training data as well as testing data to match with the imagenames and actual image names in the Training and testing directories.
After fitting the model, we can predict the results and concat the results into respective filenames and Class that image belonged to.
